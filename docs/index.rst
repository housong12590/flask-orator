* A simple but powerful `ORM <http://orator-orm.com/docs/orm.html>`_
* A database agnostic `Schema Builder <http://orator-orm.com/docs/schema_builder.html>`_
* A low level `Query Builder <http://orator-orm.com/docs/query_builder.html>`_ to avoid the overhead of the ORM
* `Migrations <http://orator-orm.com/docs/migrations.html>`_
* Support for **PostgreSQL**, **MySQL** and **SQLite** out of the box

Flask-Orator supports python versions **2.7+** and **3.2+**
